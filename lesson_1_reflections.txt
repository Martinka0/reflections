How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Not at all, since I didnâ€™t see it.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I would be able to access the record and look safe time finding errors.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You are in control of the versions you want saved.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

  In order to retrieve each file when you makes changes to them at the same time.
To be able to excess them at the exact point of change.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I can see all the commits and all the lines which have been changed and the differences between each file.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can revert back to the commit without the bug.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

  For any larger projects or for collaborations.

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I colaborate with other people and if I use more then one computer.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To make sure you only have commits which you want to make to the files.
